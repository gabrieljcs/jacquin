What?
-----
This script intends to solve the issue of choosing a restaurant near the office.


Why?
----
Because me and my coworkers couldn't reach a consensus on choosing a restaurant.

How?
----
Just fill your Google Maps API, the radius you're willing to walk and your office coordinates.
It's gonna return a random restaurant with its rating.

Should be easy to keep this in a serverless environment triggered by a webhook (Slack, Telegram).


Don't forget, *"Life is a sum of all your choices" (Albert Camus)*.
